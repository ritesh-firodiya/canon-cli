# Changelog

## Unreleased

zeno rebuilt as a Claude Code plugin plus a CLI. Everything below is new since
the original `zeno-ai` workflow CLI.

### Added

- **Plugin**: constitution and standards loaded at session start, the `weigh`
  decision gate with a `challenger` agent, and `ask`, `decision`, `ingest`,
  `standards`, `wiki-lint` skills. Knowledge search through QMD.
- **CLI** (`npm install -g @freetesh/zeno`, Node 22+): `init`, `add`, `check`,
  `standards`, `sync`, `status`, `doctor`, `learn`, `weigh`, `ui`.
- **Packs**: vendor docs (`llms.txt`) for expo, firebase, nextjs, react,
  revenuecat and uniwind, indexed for search.
- **Architecture module**: each repo keeps its import rules in
  `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` (one per workspace in a monorepo); `zeno check`
  enforces them, `weigh` cites them, `zeno ui` draws each repo's import graph.
  `init` writes starters and a shared base; `sync` keeps the base current.
- `init` asks for kind, modules and packs, and takes `--kind`, `--modules`,
  `--packs` for a no-questions setup.
- Plugin evals on a fixture product.
- `wiki.types` and `context.folders` in `zeno.yaml`: a team adds page types and
  `.context` folders, each with a `reason:`. Built-in ones cannot be redefined.
- `metrics-definitions` check: warns when the `metrics` module is on and
  `.context/metrics/definitions.yml` is missing.
- `dev-methods.md` standard (spec-, test- and data-driven evidence), a table of
  where each kind of document lives, and `SOURCE.*` entity pages for data tools.

### Changed

- Every module is optional. Designs and docs are no longer required; an estate
  that wants designs first adds that as its own command.
- `zeno learn` decisions are stored with the estate, not inside the zeno install.
- `metrics` is no longer a default module; turn it on when you define metrics.
- The unused `specs` module is removed. A `zeno.yaml` that lists it fails to load.
- The weigh gate costs fewer tokens: it no longer fires on every multi-file
  change, searches the current product's collections first, and calls the
  `challenger` only for too-large requests (or when asked), handing it what was
  already read.

### Fixed

- `zeno check` and the `ingest`, `decision` and `wiki-lint` skills follow a
  team's own wiki schema and context layout instead of zeno's built-in lists.

- `sync` indexes the wiki even when qmd was installed after `init`.
- A missing tool reports "not installed — run `zeno doctor`" instead of `ENOENT`.
- Architecture checks see npm imports (rules such as `no-non-package-json`
  were silently off), and warn when a TypeScript workspace had no `.ts` file
  read instead of passing.
