# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `pipeline:` in `zeno.yaml`: ordered stages, each with `done` paths and an
  optional `gate`. The most specific layer replaces the whole list.
- `pipeline` check: fails when a stage starts before an earlier gate is
  approved, once per gate.
- `zeno approve <stage>`: a person records a gate approval, dated now, in
  `.context/raw/zeno/gates.jsonl`.
- `context-size` check (warnings): page 60 lines, decision 30, `README.md` 30,
  `tasks.md` 100; dated decision file names; `wiki/flows/`;
  `## Done` or `## Session Notes` in `tasks.md`.
- `wiki-frontmatter` warns on placeholder text (`TBD`, `none yet`).

### Changed

- The wiki keeps only what an agent would get wrong without: `last-verified` is
  the only required field, no section is required, and the schema is 70 lines
  instead of 299.
- No page per screen: a `surfaces/` page exists only for a screen with notes its
  HTML can't show. No `flow` type; a journey worth keeping is a concept.
- Decisions are one file per topic (`decisions/pricing.md`), overwritten when
  the choice changes, with a `Rejected:` line. No supersede chains.
- `tasks.md` holds open work only; a done task is deleted. `zeno init` writes
  the shorter template.
- `canonical-values` also checks prices in decisions.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-10-25

### Added

- Every verdict is logged, not just overrides. `log-verdict.mjs` takes
  `--verdict do-it` and `--outcome proceeded | stopped | overridden | dropped`;
  `--reason` is required only for an override.
- `zeno learn` opens with how often the gate let work through, stopped it, or
  was overridden.

### Changed

- `zeno learn` proposals count only overrides. A line with no `outcome` (all
  lines before 0.10.0) is read as an override, so old logs mean what they did.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-10-25

### Added

- `manual: <where>` access for a `SOURCE.*` page whose data lives in a
  dashboard with no API (RevenueCat, store consoles). The gate asks the user
  for the numbers instead of guessing.

### Fixed

- Terms the gate shows are always a numbered list, wherever they appear.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-25

### Added

- C-14 *Facts, not assumptions* and C-15 *Plain words* in the constitution. The
  weigh gate lists each claim in a request and marks it backed, partly backed
  or not backed. DO IT needs nothing assumed. Going on despite an assumption
  takes written, numbered terms the user agrees to; `log-verdict.mjs --term`
  logs each one.
- The gate reads a repo's `SOURCE.*` pages to check claims, under query rules in
  `wiki-schema.md`: read only, small queries, counts not people.
- `sources` check: a `SOURCE.*` page names how to read it in its `ACCESS` row
  (`mcp:`, `skill:` or `cli:`, and a `cli:` must be in `doctor.tools`) and has
  a `## How to query` section.
- Evals `source-backed` and `go-ahead-is-not-agreement` (nine cases in all).

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-23

### Added

- `wiki.types` and `context.folders` in `zeno.yaml`: a team adds page types and
  `.context` folders, each with a `reason:`. An added type lists its required
  `sections:`, and `zeno check` fails a page that misses one. Built-in ones
  cannot be redefined.
- `metrics-definitions` check: warns when the `metrics` module is on and
  `.context/metrics/definitions.yml` is missing.
- `dev-methods.md` standard (spec-, test- and data-driven evidence), a table of
  where each kind of document lives, and `SOURCE.*` entity pages for data tools.
- Evals `added-wiki-type` and `evidence-first` (seven cases in all).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the unused `specs` module is removed. A `zeno.yaml` that lists
  it fails to load.
- **Breaking:** `metrics` is no longer a default module; turn it on when you
  define metrics. Where it is on, a missing `definitions.yml` is a warning.
- The weigh gate costs fewer tokens: it no longer fires on every multi-file
  change, searches the current product's collections first, and calls the
  `challenger` only for too-large requests (or when asked), handing it what was
  already read.
- `/decision` copies the shape of a recent decision page instead of reading the
  whole wiki schema.

### Fixed

- `zeno check` and the `ingest`, `decision` and `wiki-lint` skills follow a
  team's own wiki schema and context layout instead of zeno's built-in lists.

## 0.7.0

zeno rebuilt as a Claude Code plugin plus a CLI. Everything below is new since
the original `zeno-ai` workflow CLI.

### Added

- **Plugin**: constitution and standards loaded at session start, the `weigh`
  decision gate with a `challenger` agent, and `ask`, `decision`, `ingest`,
  `standards`, `wiki-lint` skills. Knowledge search through QMD.
- **CLI** (`npm install -g @freetesh/zeno`, Node 22+): `init`, `add`, `check`,
  `standards`, `sync`, `status`, `doctor`, `learn`, `weigh`, `ui`.
- **Packs**: vendor docs (`llms.txt`) for expo, firebase, nextjs, react,
  revenuecat and uniwind, indexed for search.
- **Architecture module**: each repo keeps its import rules in
  `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` (one per workspace in a monorepo); `zeno check`
  enforces them, `weigh` cites them, `zeno ui` draws each repo's import graph.
  `init` writes starters and a shared base; `sync` keeps the base current.
- `init` asks for kind, modules and packs, and takes `--kind`, `--modules`,
  `--packs` for a no-questions setup.
- Plugin evals on a fixture product.

### Changed

- Every module is optional. Designs and docs are no longer required; an estate
  that wants designs first adds that as its own command.
- `zeno learn` decisions are stored with the estate, not inside the zeno install.

### Fixed

- `sync` indexes the wiki even when qmd was installed after `init`.
- A missing tool reports "not installed — run `zeno doctor`" instead of `ENOENT`.
- Architecture checks see npm imports (rules such as `no-non-package-json`
  were silently off), and warn when a TypeScript workspace had no `.ts` file
  read instead of passing.
